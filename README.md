Baraba ́si–Albert (BA): 
In BA, the default edge density is set to 4, i.e., |E| = 4|V|. 

Bipartite Graph (BP): 
Given the number of nodes, they are partitioned into two sets with 20% nodes in one side and the rest in other. 
The edge between any pair of nodes from different partitions is generated with probability 0.1.
